# Arete Backend

Server is running at https://arete-backend-api.herokuapp.com

To run locally:

```
npm install 
```
to download dependencies.

Then call 
```
npm run serverstart
```
This runs the files with nodemon so live changes are reflected.

## Todo:
- [ ] Database pagination
- [ ] Make endpoints for looking for students/tutors
- [ ] Centralized Error Handling
- [ ] User Authentication
